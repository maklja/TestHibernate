# NHibernate Testing Project

Welcome to the NHibernate Testing Project! This project is designed for testing NHibernate with the .NET framework and PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

1. Before you dive in, make sure you have PostgreSQL up and running on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maklja/TestHibernate.git
cd TestHibernate
```

2. **Configure PostgreSQL:**
Open the **Mappings/hibernate.cfg.xml** file. Ensure that the connection string is properly set to match your PostgreSQL database configuration.

## Running the Project
Once you have set up the project and configured the database, you are ready to run the NHibernate Testing Project. Happy coding!
